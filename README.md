# TalkFlow

A new talk engine like RevealJS.

I want to use a simplified language like MarkDown or AsciiDoc to generate the presentation.

## How to create a presentation

In a `src` directory, create a `main.tfs` file which is the entry point of your presentation.

## TFS Syntax

```
# Main title

## Title of a new slide

!include(another_file)

__italic__

**bold**
```
